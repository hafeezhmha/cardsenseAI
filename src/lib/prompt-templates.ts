// Creates a standalone question from the chat-history and the current question
export const STANDALONE_QUESTION_TEMPLATE = `Given the Chat History and a Follow Up Input, rephrase the Follow Up Input to be a standalone question.

IMPORTANT: First, analyze the Follow Up Input. 
If the Follow Up Input, on its own, appears to be a simple greeting (e.g., "hi", "hello", "hey"), an introduction (e.g., "my name is Hafeez"), or a basic social pleasantry, then the Standalone question MUST be EXACTLY the same as the Follow Up Input. In this specific case, do NOT try to infer a topic or relate it to the Chat History or any prior context.

For all other types of Follow Up Input, rephrase it to be a standalone question, taking into account the Chat History to resolve references and understand the context of the Follow Up Input.

Chat History:
{chat_history}
Follow Up Input: {question}
Standalone question:`;

First, consider if the user's question is a simple greeting, an introduction (e.g., "hi", "hello", "my name is..."), or a very general social interaction. If it is, respond in a friendly, conversational way. You can acknowledge their introduction if they made one. For such initial interactions, you do not need to use the provided context pieces if they are not directly relevant to the greeting itself.

For all other questions, use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. 
If you don't know the answer based on the context, just say you don't know. DO NOT try to make up an answer.
If the question is not related to the context, politely respond that you are tuned to only answer questions that are related to the context.
